# ICD File Manager - Enhanced Dependencies
# Core dependencies for the ICD File Manager application with 3D preview support

# GUI Framework (usually included with Python)
# tkinter>=8.6.0  # Included with Python

# Database
# sqlite3>=3.0.0  # Included with Python

# Essential Image Processing (for file preview and thumbnails)
Pillow>=9.0.0

# 3D Model Processing Libraries
# Choose ONE of these main 3D libraries for rendering STEP files converted from ICD:

# Option 1: Open3D (Recommended for 3D model rendering)
# Pros: Excellent rendering, good STEP support when files are converted
# Cons: Larger download size (~100MB)
open3d>=0.16.0

# Option 2: Trimesh (Alternative, lighter weight)
# Pros: Smaller size, good for basic 3D operations
# Cons: Less robust than Open3D for complex models
# trimesh>=3.15.0

# Mathematical Operations (for 3D transformations)
numpy>=1.21.0

# File System Monitoring
watchdog>=2.1.0

# File Type Detection
python-magic>=0.4.27

# Date/Time Handling
python-dateutil>=2.8.0

# JSON Handling (included with Python)
# json  # Included with Python

# Path Handling (included with Python)
# pathlib  # Included with Python

# Optional Dependencies (for enhanced functionality)

# Excel/CSV Processing
openpyxl>=3.0.0

# PDF Processing
PyPDF2>=2.0.0

# Archive Handling
patoolib>=1.12.0

# Development Dependencies (optional)
# pytest>=7.0.0
# pytest-cov>=4.0.0
# black>=22.0.0
# flake8>=5.0.0

# Platform-specific dependencies

# Windows specific
pywin32>=304; platform_system=="Windows"

# Linux specific
python-magic-bin>=0.4.14; platform_system=="Linux"

# macOS specific
# No specific dependencies for macOS

# Installation Notes:
# ==================
# 
# RECOMMENDED INSTALLATION ORDER FOR ICD FILES:
# 1. pip install Pillow numpy
# 2. pip install open3d
# 3. pip install watchdog python-magic python-dateutil
# 4. pip install remaining optional dependencies
#
# ALTERNATIVE LIGHTWEIGHT SETUP:
# 1. pip install Pillow numpy
# 2. pip install trimesh
# 3. pip install watchdog python-magic python-dateutil
#
# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# - If Open3D fails to install, try: pip install open3d --no-cache-dir
# - If python-magic fails on Windows, try: pip install python-magic-bin
#
# MINIMUM SETUP (basic functionality only):
# pip install Pillow watchdog python-dateutil
#
# ICD FILE SUPPORT NOTES:
# - This app focuses specifically on .icd files
# - 3D thumbnails are generated using multiple fallback methods:
#   1. Converting ICD to STEP files (if conversion tools available)
#   2. Finding existing thumbnail images alongside ICD files
#   3. Extracting embedded thumbnails from ICD files
#   4. Using ICD CLI tools for thumbnail generation
#   5. Creating placeholder thumbnails with file information
#
# Minimum Python version: 3.8+
